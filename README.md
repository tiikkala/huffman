# Approximating travelling salesman problem with minimum spanning trees

Here lies my implementation of minimum spanning tree approximation alrogithm for the famous travelling salesman problem written in Java.
As this project was done for data structures and algorithms course, I haven't utilized any of Java's existing libraries on the execution
of the algorithm.
